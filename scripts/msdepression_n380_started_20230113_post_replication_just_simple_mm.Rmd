## MS Depression

Welcome to the MS Depression Data! This project was designed to ask a relatively simple question - are patients with MS who are depressed more likely to have lesions in fascicles that connect areas previously associated with depression. The literature are sparse in this domain. It is very clear that depression occurs in up to 50% of patients with MS, and some studies have suggested that it relates to lesion burden. But to my knowledge there are no papers that evaluate how lesions disrupt white matter tracts that serve as the backbone for functional networks. Over the course of the next few chunks, I'll walk through our analysis. It combines imaging data from research grade scans acquired at 3T as part of a clinical protocol (T1 and T2 Flair), and clinical data from the electronic medical record.  

The first chunk here is reading in appropriate data frames and preprocessing. A few big data frames are read in. The first is the demographic, drug, lab info for the MS patients (from the DAC pull). The second is the data frame of fascicle proportion affected for people with good MIMoSA (# volume affected/total volume of fascicle). The most important preprocessing occurs in a series of mutate commands. These essentially add new columns to the data frame that can later be used. The thrust of these mutate commands is to define who has depression and who does not.

Of note, in prior iterations of this analysis, we did not consider psychiatric medications in determining group inclusion/exclusion. Turns out it makes a difference, as a lot of people on psychotropic medications were counted as "controls/healthy" in previous analyses. For these preliminary analysis, our inclusion/exclusion are more stringent. Of note, the graph below is irrespective of whether they had good/bad MIMoSA. As such, the MIMoSA subset is smaller.

### Inclusion/Exclusion

#### Inclusion MS Criteria (dataframe read in here has already been filtered down using the exclusions below previously)

  1) Scanned under MS protocol (42K)
  
  2) MS Diagnosis (17K)
  
  3) Seen by MS doctor (16K)
  
#### Inclusion criteria for Depressed Group (one of the three criteria must be met)
  
  1) Have an ICD10 F3* code (in our sample, people have F32 (depressive episode), F33 (major depressive disorder), and F34 (Persistent mood [affective] disorders)) 
        - there are NO participants with bipolar disorder, manic episode, or unspecified mood/affective disorder
        - while participants may have been diagnosed with F06.3 (Depressive disorder due to known physiological condition, with depressive features), they must ALSO have had an F3(2-4) condition

  2) Screened positive for depression on PHQ2 or PHQ9 at any point

  3) Prescribed antidepressant medications per NAMI website
        - https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Treatments/Mental-Health-Medications
        
#### Inclusion criteria for Nondepressed Group (ALL three criteria must be met)
 
  1) No F* diagnoses
 
  2) At least 1 PHQ2 or PHQ9 with a documented 0
 
  3) Free of psychiatric medications per NAMI website

#### EMR Exclusions

  If you received the MS protocol or had a diagnosis of MS but never actually saw an MS provider, we cannot be sure that the diagnosis of MS is truly valid, as it is hard to diagnose anyway.
  If you did not have a diagnosis of depression and never completed a PHQ2 or 9, and had no history of medications, we could not safely confirm nor deny the presence of depression. These subjects were excluded from future analyses. We could consider adding these to the healthy group maybe, but not too inclined to do that right now. 

#### Imaging exclusion

  We are currently only using people who had good MIMoSA (75 or 100). That severely limits our numbers, but that is okay! When we re-QC, we will probably get a lot more into this group. We are specifically using their FIRST scan. 

### Group validation and depression network definition

#### Functional Impairment Scores

  To validate our grouping, we wanted to compare symptom burden between patients with depression and nondepressed comparators. One challenge of EMR research is that we are limited to what has been coded in particular fields, and could not readily assess our patients, or access their notes. As PHQ2 and 9 were used in dignostic categorization, they, by default differ between groups and are less informative. MS impairment is often assessed and recorded via EDSS, but this is not currently coded in the EMR. However, the Penn EMR has started recording Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Per the NIH, "PROMIS addressed a need in the clinical research community for a rigorously tested patient reported outcome (PRO) measurement tool that uses recent advances in information technology, psychometrics, and qualitative, cognitive, and health survey research to measure PROs such as pain, fatigue, physical functioning, emotional distress, and social role participation that have a major impact on quality-of-life across a variety of chronic diseases." PROMIS scores, for reference, are scored where higher numbers mean better functioning, and lower numbers mean worse functioning.
  
  A small subset of our participents (36 in non-depressed group and 49 in depressed group) had PROMIS scores. For participants who had multiple PROMIS scores, the score that was analyzed was the closest in time proximity to the day of the scan. PROMIS score cleaning and linking of score to scan is performed in a separate markdown **(promis_score_cleaning_2010-2022.Rmd). **

  Based on previous MS literature, we hypothesized that our patients with depression would overall show more functional impairment than patients without depression. 

#### Depression Network Construction

  A note on the "depression network." This network was made by Shan Siddiqi in Michael Fox's group by doing a conglomeration of TMS datasets, stroke datasets, Nature Human Behavior 2021 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01161-1). It is an unthresholded mask (he initially sent one where the unit is r, but then sent us one where unit is T). 
  Per Siddiqi's article: The location of each lesion or brain stimulation site (Fig. 2a–c, top panels) was mapped to an underlying brain circuit using a large normative connectome database (n=1000) and previously validated methods (Fig. 2a–c, bottom panels)5. The normative connectome was used to estimate connectivity of each lesion or stimulation site to every voxel in the brain. At each voxel, a Pearson r-value was computed for the correlation between depression score and lesion or stimulation site connectivity to that voxel (Fig. 2a–c, right panels), yielding a population-derived “circuit map” for each of the 14 datasets (Supplementary Figure 1). We generated a combined depression circuit map by taking the mean of all 14 circuit maps, weighted by the sample size of each dataset (Fig. 5a). Of note, lesions are expected to positively correlate with symptoms, whereas the inverse of tms sites and was (so connectivity in these areas was inverted).
  
  To use it, I thresholded the clusters (3.09), binarized it and then used it as an ROI and calculated, per fascicle, the volume occupied by the fascicle that intersected with the depression mask. Most fascicles were either entirely overlapping or entirely outside the depression mask, though the range of overlap was anywhere from 1-30% (volume of fascicle overlap/total volume of fascicle). This required us to make some choices. We considered an option where the "depression mask" was anywhere that ever overlapped, and non-depression were areas where there was no overlap. We also looked at quartiles, and settled on the top 25% (top quartile), i.e. the top 25% of fascicles with the highest volume of network overlap were considered in the depression network. Everything outside of that was considered "non_depression" network, or nondep_net. Cranial nerves are too small to reliably be assess with our method, and so they were removed from the analysis.In total, 77 fascicles were evaluated.
  

### Analyses
  Demographic differences between groups were assessed with T-tests and chi-square for categorical variables w/the command CreateTableOne.
  
#### *Disease burden measures per individual (done in the shell):*
  
    For each individual, the number of 1s in the MIMoSA binary mask were summed to get a measure of overall lesion burden (to be distinguished from fascicle burden).
    
    To assess fascicle burden for each individual, streamline filtering was performed.
  
    Streamline filtering is an interative process performed in DSI studio. For each individual, the MIMoSA binary map was considered a region of interest. For each of the 77 fascicles, streamlines that ran through the lesion were "filtered" or kept, whereas the fascicles that avoided the MIMoSA mask were eliminated. Streamlines that passed through the MIMoSA were then saved binary .nii files, where 1 indicated that disease was present in that voxel, and 0 indicated either 1) that fascicle did not cross through that voxel or there was no disease in it. 
  
    I was then able to calculate the "volume" of the disease in a fascicle (i.e. volume of the streamlines that were affected) by summing the # of 1s in the map. At the end, each individual had 77 single values that represented the volume of affected streamlines within each fascicle.
  
    Full fascicle volumes were also calculated and saved as .niis. 
  
####  *Disease burden summary measures (done in this R script):*
  
    Having computed disease measures at the individual fascicle, I wanted to assess network effects for all future analyses. To do this, I calculated three summary measures per individual. 
    
    1) Total disease : Sum of all 77 volume measures of disease, divided by the total volume of "healthy" fascicles (i.e. taking a sum of all of the full fascicle volumes). This yields a proportion of the overall burden of disease in the brain
    
    2) Depression network: Sum of all 19 volume measures of disease in the fascicles within the depression network, divided by the sum of total full fascicle volumes in the depression network.
    
    3) Nondepression network: Sum of all 58 volume measures of disease in the fascicles outside the depression network, divided by the sum of total full fascicle volumes in the nondepression network.
    

#### Network, Diagnosis, and Network * Diagnosis 

Model: diagnosis_by_network_interaction_lmer <- lmer(proportion_affected ~ Diagnosis*Network + (1|subject), data = df_empi_dx_network_proportions)



####  *Network effects:*
   
   Given that depression is so common in multiple sclerosis, we first wanted to check whether disease was diffuse across the brain, or whether there was network specificity (i.e. is MS random, or do MS lesions happen to strike fascicles that support the depression network, irrespective of diagnosis). To assess this, we looked at the main effect of network in the linear mixed model. Effect sizes were calculated with confint.  
   
    
   
####  *Diagnostic effects:*
  
  Per our inclusion/exclusion criteria, we were able to identify a subset of patients that had depression, as well as a subset who did not meet criteria per EMR review. We next wanted to assess whether patients with depression had more overall disease than patients without depression. To assess this, we looked at the main effect of diagnosis in the linear mixed model. Effect sizes were calculated with confint.  
  
    We also assessed whether lesion burden (i.e. the volume occupied by white matter disease), irrespective of which fascicles were impacted, differed between patients and controls. 
  
    1) Tests for normality (Shapiro–Wilk test), volume of lesions not normally distributed.
  
    2) Used wilcoxon tests to compare lesion burden between depressed and non-depressed patients. As each person only contributed one measure, paired = F.
  
#### *NetworkxDiagnosis effects: *
  
  We next aimed to see whether there was an interaction of Diagnosis and Network. Specifically, we hypothesized that patients with depression would have more disease specifically in the depression network.
  
     1) Model: diagnosis_by_network_interaction_lmer <- lmer(proportion_affected ~ Diagnosis*Network + (1|subject), data = df_empi_dx_network_proportions)
  
  Given the somewhat arbitrary definition of depression network (25%/75%), we next assessed whether the relationship between diagnosis and network was continuous. 
  
    1) For each fascicle, two values were computed
    
      a) Effect size (r) from the wilcoxon statistic comparing volume of disease in the fascicle between depressed vs nondepressed
    
      b) The volume of the overlap of that fascicle with the depression network
  
    2) A linear model relating the overlap of volume of the fascicle w/the depression network to the effect size from the depressed v nondepressed wilcoxon analysis.
  
    3) This relationship was permuted 10,000 w/boot (w/replacement)
  
    4) Plots were generated
  
####  *Sensitivity Analyses*
  
  Though the effect size by overlap analysis was reassuring, we wanted to further guarantee that our findings were not driven by arbitrary distinctions between the depression and non-depression networks. To assess this, we repeated the network analysis using tertiles and quintiles. LMER for assessing interactions was used. 
  
    1) Tertiles: 
      
      a) Depression network: Top Tertile
      b) Nondepression network: Bottom 2 Tertiles
    
    2) Quintiles: 
      
      a) Depression network: Top Quintile
      b) Nondepression network: Bottom 4 Quintiles

  This is actually great news - if depressed/nondepressed individuals differed on fatigue, you could make the case that of COURSE they'd feel worse as a consequence of their fatigue. However, that they weren't different here lends some specificity to the measures.

#This chunk reads in a file where columns are fascicle, num_voxels_total, non_zero_voxels_in_dep_map, prop_in_mask

# Of course, it is possible that huge fascicles contribute a ton to the depression network, but also the non-depression network

But then you have a situation where tiny fibers get lots of credit. We have actually tried this as well and the findings aren't that different.
